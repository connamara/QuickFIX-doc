# QuickFIX-doc
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/connamara/QuickFIX-doc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/connamara/QuickFIX-doc)

QuickFIX-doc parses QuickFIX data dictionary .xml files into descriptive [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) files using [RstCloth](https://pypi.org/project/rstcloth/), and then runs them through the [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/) documentation generation library for Python.

## Usage
```
quickfixdoc PATH/TO/DD.xml PATH/TO/OUTPUT/DIRECTORY [BUILDER (default: html)]
```

Example:
```
> quickfixdoc ~/Documents/quickfix/spec/FIX44.xml ./FIX_44_Spec/
QuickFIXdoc

## Install
1) Ensure Python is installed on your machine - [see here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)
2) Run `pip install https://github.com/connamara/QuickFIX-doc/archive/master.zip` in a shell

## Tests
1) Ensure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) is installed on your machine
2) Execute `./acceptance.sh`
3) Detailed reports will be available for each vanilla FIX spec under `./acceptance/FIX*`
    * Each subdirectory includes [Robot Framework](http://robotframework.org/) report files
    * `log.html`, `report.html`, and `output.xml`

## Background and Goals
Writing specs for FIX **sucks**. QuickFIX-doc helps you "save time and look good" by taking care of the specification generation for you.

All you need is a valid QuickFIX data dictionary. No need for any custom word documents, no chance for human error, just run and view your nice beautiful spec.
